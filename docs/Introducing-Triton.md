Goal of project: 

 build foundational GPU optimization skills with applications across ML workflows


Triton is under active development and use, supported not only by OpenAI but also by partnerships with other major tech companies like Meta and Microsoft, which seek alternatives to CUDA for enhanced GPU performance. This broad backing highlights Triton's utility in optimizing GPU operations for machine learning tasks, including those involving model evaluation, reinforcement learning, and feedback workflows


To focus on RLHF and model evaluations, Triton can be highly beneficial if your work involves significant GPU optimization, such as processing large datasets, implementing fused operations (like custom softmax or matrix multiplications), or speeding up reward model computations. Triton’s architecture enables writing concise, high-performance GPU kernels in Python, which can outperform general-purpose libraries like PyTorch on certain tasks. This makes it particularly valuable for RLHF, where you may need efficient GPU operations for real-time feedback or large-batch processing

The challenges of GPU programming
The architecture of modern GPUs can be roughly divided into three major components—DRAM, SRAM and ALUs—each of which must be considered when optimizing CUDA code:

Memory transfers from DRAM must be coalesced into large transactions to leverage the large bus width of modern memory interfaces.
Data must be manually stashed to SRAM prior to being re-used, and managed so as to minimize shared memory bank conflicts upon retrieval.
Computations must be partitioned and scheduled carefully, both across and within Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), so as to promote instruction/thread-level parallelism and leverage special-purpose ALUs (e.g., tensor cores).
