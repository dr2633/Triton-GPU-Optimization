Project Outline
Objective and Overview:
Goal: Demonstrate how Triton can optimize GPU-based operations for RLHF workflows in a synthetic HAI environment.
Scope: Focus on Triton applications in RLHF, particularly reward modeling, synthetic data generation, and large-scale data processing.
Modules and Stages:
Synthetic Data Generation:
Generate or simulate human interaction data (e.g., feedback or preferences on AI responses).
Use Triton to efficiently batch and process synthetic data at scale.
Reward Model Optimization:
Implement reward model training that scales with Triton, covering both data ingestion and batched gradient computations.
Showcase Triton’s advantage in performing these tasks over traditional frameworks.
Training Policy Models with RLHF:
Use synthetic reward signals to fine-tune an AI policy model (e.g., via PPO or DQN) optimized with Triton.
Highlight Triton’s utility for batching rewards and optimizing policy gradients.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained policy on new synthetic HAI interactions to show improvements in response quality.
Create metrics visualization for model performance and efficiency comparisons (e.g., Triton vs. other frameworks).
